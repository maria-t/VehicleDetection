# VehicleDetection
This project is part of Udacity self-driving car engineer Nanodegree program and is about locating and classifying objects in images. It specifically focuses on detecting vehicles in images taken form a camera mounted on the front of a car. Same tools could apply for detecting pedestrians or any other objects in an image.
